<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>

As the data are instantly available and input into your retail POS accounting back office software, you can now spot trends as they happen, not after they are long gone. Each day restaurants handle large volumes of cash and credit card transactions, making a POS system necessary.

POS systems also affect the kitchen, as many POS systems either include, or interface with, a ticketing system to help keep orders organized and service moving smoothly.

But, an employee management module of a POS system can help you manage your staffing levels, employee hours, and sales performance which helps you to track employee productivity.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments).

<p>I've used livepos since I opened my store in 2014 and it never disappoints me. I like this software because it never stops developing so that many new features have been added and always so helpful to my business. Simplify your accounting process, build demand conscious rosters, generate online orders, and drive sales through loyalty programs with hospitality's most integrated point of sale. The point of sales software is defined by its collection centre which needs to be efficient while collecting tender information, redeeming loyalty points, gift vouchers or coupon codes or applying any bill discounts or promotions.</p>
<p>Seating plans â€” The advantage of a POS system is that you can dynamically seat customers as tables become available. The server stores all the data which relates to the Point of Sale system, allowing the information to be locked into one secure location. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost.</p>
<p>The retail boom has been fuelled by new business model of franchising where multiple entrepreneurs take up part of the risk of inventory.
