<p>Most restaurants find that point of sale (pos) systems really are better for their work environment. A Point of Sale system enables cashiers to process transactions and serve customers efficiently, and allows managers to maintain tight control. The software integrates with QuickBooks Desktop financial software, ecommerce platforms, and other POS systems. Most POS software helps you stay aware of how your business is performing. There are many types of POS systems, and you can pick up the apt POS solution depending on the requirement and nature of your business.</p>

<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
