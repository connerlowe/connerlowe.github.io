Easier payment options : When payments of the checks are as easy as swiping or tapping a card, not only do the staffs not have to worry about keeping tab over the patrons upon serving the checks but also ensure that the patrons enjoy a hassle-free check-out after a night's merriment. The best restaurant POS systems are also cost-effective, well reviewed, easy to use, and come with a professional customer support team.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

<p>Lightspeed is a cloud-based Point of Sales (POS) and eCommerce solution. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. Opt for the Revel Advantage plan, and payments can be processed for a flat fee through Revel for an EMV-ready, Apple Pay-ready, all-cards-accepted service.</p>

Win back churned customers and increase customer lifetime value with in-built loyalty that tracks all customer contacts and purchasing preferences; launch targeted promotions, offers, and personalized campaigns that keep customers coming back.
