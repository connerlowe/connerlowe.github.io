<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>
<p>Interested businesses can give Quickbooks' POS a free trial and pricing is dependent on the hardware and software bundle a business opts for. Many systems let you individually track employee details, shifts, payroll, and more and then send that data to accounting software. Unified technologies are integral in this balance, offering a truer picture of your business and customers so you can discover and act on opportunities to better serve your customers.</p>
<p>Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.
