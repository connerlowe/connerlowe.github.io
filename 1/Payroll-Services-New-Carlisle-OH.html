Hardware: This includes routers, terminals, kiosks, handheld devices, card readers, kitchen display systems, printers, and guest-facing display. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients.

It may also need to be integrated with property management software.</p>
