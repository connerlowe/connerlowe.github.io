<p>Among the most common inventory management features available in POS software are reminders to inform you when stock of a certain product is running low. Vend is mobile, so you can take your point of sale system onto the shop floor, beat the queues and build personal engagement with your customers. POS once referred only to the siteâ€”typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services.</p>
<p>Since this is a cloud-based Point of Sales system, you can always check your inventory level and order new goods whether you are in the office, at home or on the go. You can control your inventory through streamlined reorder processes and easily transfer goods from one location to another. The POS software stores the information and maintains it within a database. There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely.</p>
<p>Rugged hardware is required for point of sale systems used in outdoor environments. There are also advanced employee management and inventory features that will cost you extra. Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments. From Daily Sales Reports to Monthly, Quaterly and Annual Business reports in almost any exportable formats.

<p>Another significant advantage of using a restaurant management software is the ability to send orders directly to the kitchen - this is a considerable advantage by increasing food prep time, staff efficiency, and reducing errors in the kitchen. Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. A modern POS system will consist of a touchscreen computer that operates with POS software that's used to complete product orders and accept all payment types.</p>
<p>If you're in need of a POS that has great robust inventory management built in to it then I suggest you give the Hike a test and consider it.
