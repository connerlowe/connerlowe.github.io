<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow. Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories.</p>
<p>Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu. Choosing a system that uses unlocked POS hardware can save you money because, if you decide to switch systems, you may be able to continue using the unlocked equipment. ShopKeep also offers a countertop POS hardware for the register, card reader and receipt printer. It also has a built-in timeclock and sales reports that show your most popular items, busiest hours, and top employees.</p>
<p>Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction. For about $4,000, you can get a traditional bar POS system which includes a touchscreen monitor with a built-in PC, a credit card reader, a cash drawer, a receipt printer, and all the cabling required. Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications.</p>

<p>A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal. Multichannel Customer Experience — retailers who manage online stores along with physical stores should have the option in their POS system to provide the same consistent product and pricing information to their customers, whether online or onsite.</p>
