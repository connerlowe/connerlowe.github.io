<p>Selecting the best retail point of sale (POS) system is not something to take lightly. Hardware: This includes routers, terminals, kiosks, handheld devices, card readers, kitchen display systems, printers, and guest-facing display. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients. Provides an invaluable tool that allows you to not only process purchases but integrates inventory, customer info, returns, exchanges, credit card processing, rewards programs, sales, records, etc all on one machine.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing‚Äù because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS).

<h2>From Chip And Pin To Wave And Pay Kittery</h2>

If you need robust inventory management, reporting, integrations, and lots of customization options - consider Revel. Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
