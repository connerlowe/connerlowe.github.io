A modern POS system will consist of a touchscreen computer that operates with POS software that's used to complete product orders and accept all payment types.</p>
<p>Advanced POS reporting notifies managers of employee or customer theft, shows menu and liquor sales trends over time, and analyzes customer data with built-in CRM. The basic function of a restaurant point of sale system is to facilitate customer orders and accept payment. That means you can make sales at trade shows, kiosks, special events and more - and that you can monitor sales and inventory from anywhere in the world, even when you can't be in the store in person.</p>
<p>As consumer technology evolves and consumer behaviors change, mobile POS systems are increasingly focusing on evolving their omnichannel selling capabilities and blurring the lines between online and in-store retail. Point of sale (POS) system is the spot where your customer makes the payment for goods or services that are offered by your company.
