<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information.

Every business is unique, and TallySales Retail Management Systems allows you to run your business your way.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

With the online payment gateway, restaurants can accept modern payment methods like Apple Pay. And just like Lightspeed, ShopKeep Restaurant POS is available via a web-based dashboard and an iOS app, which serves as the primary cash register.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is a cloud-based Point of Sales (POS) and eCommerce solution.

Opt for the Revel Advantage plan, and payments can be processed for a flat fee through Revel for an EMV-ready, Apple Pay-ready, all-cards-accepted service.</p>
<p>Inventory management for restaurants is absolutely essential. Their self-service option makes it possible for customers to order directly from an iPad at their table which cuts down on wait-times and increases sales.
