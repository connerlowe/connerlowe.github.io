All sorts of payments are accepted: cash, credit, debit, check, gift card, and store credit. Its Brink POS software is designed for quick-service and fast casual eateries, and its PixelPoint POS is for full-service restaurants. This software includes table management and reservation management features as well as social media integration so you can easily send a Facebook invite or post to Twitter. Additionally, your bar menu needs to be friendly to the customers in your establishment.</p>
<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>

Meet the real side of your retail business and never again blind-guess your store performance.</p>

<p>Most businesses will want a card machine and a receipt printer. Note that a POS should not be confused with a credit card processing system A credit card processing system is a component of a point of sale system, but the POS can also handle a variety of functions beyond the processing of credit card payments. SalesVu POS takes a different approach to most POS providers. Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes.</p>
<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.

These features can also help manage those customers and page them when work has been completed.</p>
