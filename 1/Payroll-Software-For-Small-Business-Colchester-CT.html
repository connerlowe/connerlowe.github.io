<p>You mention how a point of sale is the most important place for customers to visit since it is the place the customer can go. I always thought the point of sale was more of a phase in the shopping experience but explain how it simply means it is where the customer pays for the goods or services provided. Foodie365cloud Restaurant isn't your average point of sale system. KORONA integrates with a variety of EMV and mobile-compatible payment terminals without forcing retailers into one specific credit card processor.</p>
