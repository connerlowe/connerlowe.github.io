<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. All in all, offering NFC, EMV, and magstripe payments guarantees you will be able to accommodate your customers no matter their payment method.</p>
<p>Intuitive inventory management and ordering tools save time and money, while dynamic scheduling tools help you ensure you have the right amount of staff in-house at all times. One cool benefit of POS software is that it can build individual profiles of all your customers and track their purchase history and shopping habits. They go above and beyond payment processing by automating all the critical management tasks, hence streamlining business operations as well as communication.</p>
<p>The highly functional software ensures better table and menu management, inventory management, and portable operations with portable app reporting. It can make a real difference to how much time you spend on processing sales, replenishing stock and even training your staff. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time. With POS software, restaurant managers and owners can meet many of their practical business needs, from managing daily service all the way up to high-level analytics.</p>
