<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. With Mink Foodiee in-depth reporting and analytics, view real-time reports from anywhere, anytime, and make quick data-driven decisions for your restaurant. We provide custom configured systems with computer hardware and software, all ready to plug and play. POS systems have been touted as valuable tools for a wide variety of business purposes, including refining target marketing strategies; tracking supplier purchases; determining customer purchasing patterns; analyzing sales (on a daily, monthly, or annual basis) of each inventory item, department, or supplier; and creating reports for use in making purchases, reorders, etc.</p>
<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types. A mobile POS system means better, faster customer management processes. Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.</p>

You get to manage your retail business using a unified interface, which means you can instantly accept payments from multiple channels (credit cards, online payments, etc.) without worrying about third-party fees and restrictions and saving you a lot of time.</p>
