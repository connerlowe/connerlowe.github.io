You'll probably want a traditional set-up with a full-service POS if you have a retail store , salon, dry cleaner, or quick-serve restaurant Consider countertop POS systems, which are available in various sizes and take less space than traditional cash registers. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud.
