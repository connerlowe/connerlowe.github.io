<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock.

Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>

<p>A point-of-sale (POS) system is more than a fancy cash register. Easy to learn and navigate, the Rezku POS has appealing features specifically designed for restaurants.

<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
