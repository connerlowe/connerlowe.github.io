Everything from sales to inventory to customer management merges into your POS. When you have enough personnel on the sales floor and at the cash wrap, shoppers intuitively get the message that they are worth your time and staff investment.</p>
<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a mechanical cash register today; the majority of POS systems are electronic, meaning they use an electronic cash register or computer system. When customers call a restaurant to order take-out or delivery, they want the experience to be as quick and painless as possible — from phone call to receipt of their order. All reports about the bills, orders, sales, customers, etc. Increase sales and profit, by serving your customers faster and avoid common mistakes that happen in the point of sale checkout lane.</p>

Bottom Line: ShopKeep offers the point-of-sale (POS) system features that most small businesses will want without overwhelming them; however, the cost of add-ons can add up.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>The less time you need to spend on accounting and calculating your operational costs, the more time you have for greeting customers and improving your bar business in other areas. Restaurant POS systems are central to the very operation of a food establishment. Today's systems work with equal effectiveness for the cashier, the waiter (through great screen interactivity and intuitive interfaces) and the management (through better and timelier reporting).</p>
