<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>
