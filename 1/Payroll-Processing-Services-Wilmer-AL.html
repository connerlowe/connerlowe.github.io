<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. Processing transactions, training staff, inventory management, and accessing insights, are amongst the key features that should take you minutes, not hours to perform. Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. A restaurant POS system is a significant business investment, and it's important to treat it as such. Payments - If you plan on accepting credit card payments with your POS, then you need to sign up for a merchant account.</p>
<p>From inventory tracking to detailed reports and integrations with other business management tools, point of sale software should adapt to your business needs — not the other way around. Suitable for omni-channel retailers and wholesalers, Cin7 integrates cloud inventory, Point of Sale, warehouse management, B2B ecommerce, 3PL, and direct EDI, in one robust platform. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article.</p>

<p>Many point of sale systems offer retail-specific features, including robust inventory management, purchase ordering, CMR, loyalty programs, eCommerce, and much more.

But with plans that start at $69 per month, you get in-depth inventory, customer, and accounting management in a professional and impressive package.</p>
<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>
<p>In addition, Vend POS offers sales and inventory management, customer profiles, split and contactless payments, and gift cards.

<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Square for Restaurants is, therefore, the best POS system for quick-service restaurants, full-service restaurants, coffee shops, and bars of all sizes. If you have more than one bar location, Lightspeed can be integrated between your businesses, making it easy for you to manage all your operations. By implementing this solution in your bar or nightclub you will be in a better position to overcome the chaos that is commonly associated with the rush in the business.</p>
