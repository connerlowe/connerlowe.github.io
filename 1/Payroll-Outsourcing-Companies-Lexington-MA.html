<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. To keep the service and guest experience seamless, you need a nightclub or bar POS system that can keep up with the rush. The POS hardware you need for your bar will typically include a tablet, tablet stand, receipt printer, cash drawer, and credit card terminal or card reader.</p>

By having a POS system in place, you can understand your customers better and boost your sales significantly.

TouchBistro is one of the most used and popular iPad-based POS systems, which caters to both quick service and full-service establishments of any size.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Find out what your customers would like to see in your new POS system.
