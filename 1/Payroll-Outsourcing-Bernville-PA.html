<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. Processing transactions, training staff, inventory management, and accessing insights, are amongst the key features that should take you minutes, not hours to perform. Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. A restaurant POS system is a significant business investment, and it's important to treat it as such. Payments - If you plan on accepting credit card payments with your POS, then you need to sign up for a merchant account.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers.
