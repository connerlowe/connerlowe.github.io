<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. With Mink Foodiee in-depth reporting and analytics, view real-time reports from anywhere, anytime, and make quick data-driven decisions for your restaurant. We provide custom configured systems with computer hardware and software, all ready to plug and play. POS systems have been touted as valuable tools for a wide variety of business purposes, including refining target marketing strategies; tracking supplier purchases; determining customer purchasing patterns; analyzing sales (on a daily, monthly, or annual basis) of each inventory item, department, or supplier; and creating reports for use in making purchases, reorders, etc.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>

Use your POS system to provide you with both sales and customer information using analytic charts and reports.
