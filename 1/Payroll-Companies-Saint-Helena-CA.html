<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Brigade POS was developed by a team of experienced restauranteurs and software innovators who wanted to address the 3 core problems inherent with almost every POS system: 1. Reliability. Every business is unique, and TallySales Retail Management Systems allows you to run your business your way.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>
