<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. Processing transactions, training staff, inventory management, and accessing insights, are amongst the key features that should take you minutes, not hours to perform. Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. A restaurant POS system is a significant business investment, and it's important to treat it as such. Payments - If you plan on accepting credit card payments with your POS, then you need to sign up for a merchant account.</p>
<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business.

With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>

The software itself requires hardware components like an iPad or tablet for android OS, cash drawers, card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, and other add-ons to offer the full point of sale experience. Hence, Inventory systems are designed so that managers can order right product at the right time, in the right quantity from the right vendor and at the right price.</p>
