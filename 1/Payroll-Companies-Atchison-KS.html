<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
<p>Reward your best customers with a loyalty program tracked in your POS system. If you want control over your profit and loss, you need to start with a good inventory management function. Restaurant owners and managers can always check on their business anytime, even while on the go, thanks to TouchBistro's dependable connection and cloud-based menu management and reporting functionality. Businesses can access the software via the internet, or though iPad or iPhone apps.</p>
<p>Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice. The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software. Customer Profiling: This restaurant management software will help understand your customer preferences better so that you can design your menu and loyalty program accordingly.</p>
