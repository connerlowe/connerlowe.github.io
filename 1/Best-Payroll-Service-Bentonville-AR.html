<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>Restaurant Point of Sale Systems do much more than the typical Restaurant POS Cash Register. With a handheld mPOS your customers do not need to line up and wait at the counter when they have to place an order. The customers were required to go to the cash register where their credit cards could be processed. A typical EPoS system in not capable of being all things to all men, so it's essential that it has the capacity to be integrated into other systems within the business.</p>
<p>FusionRestro includes accounting, billing, staff and payroll functions, inventory management, and customer information management. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem. As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>

<p>Whether you're planning to get into this exciting industry or are already in it, understand that competition is stiff and almost always, between two restaurants with an equally successful menu, how efficient you provide customer service is the deal-breaker. Bindo is another iPad POS system that boasts sophisticated—yet user-friendly—inventory management features. A slow and clunky bar POS system doesn't slow down your ability to hand customers their check; it also disenchants your staff and employee turnover rates are a significant problem for bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. POS systems can suffer from internet connectivity problems and software issues. Modern POS speeds transaction times, and mobile POS adds a powerful line-busting tool to your arsenal. The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>

The Epicor Eagle N Series is Epicor's present comprehensive retail software system built around features such as multichannel sales, a point-of-sale system, and inventory and merchandising management.</p>
<p>Some tablet POS services are "free" with credit card processing; others require a low monthly subscription fee but allow you to choose your own credit card processor.
