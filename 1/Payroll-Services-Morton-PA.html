After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment.

<p>Restaurant Point of Sale Systems do much more than the typical Restaurant POS Cash Register.

The customers were required to go to the cash register where their credit cards could be processed. A typical EPoS system in not capable of being all things to all men, so it's essential that it has the capacity to be integrated into other systems within the business.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers.

<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software). Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing.

Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>Advanced POS reporting notifies managers of employee or customer theft, shows menu and liquor sales trends over time, and analyzes customer data with built-in CRM.
