<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. In addition to POS services, Habortouch also offers access to online reservations, employee management systems, and a customer database. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong. We can help you with any type of point of sale pos software to satiate your needs. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success.</p>
<p>More than simply a way to take orders and ring up sales, a POS system gives you total control over every important operational aspect of your restaurant. This POS system gives the owner features like inventory and sales tracking, monitoring products, and menu items, and generating reports. Today we're using Retail Pro in 350 stores worldwide. They can handle numerous kinds of payments and communicate well with back-end accounting software.</p>

Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place. Two robust sets of tools are offered - a free Square POS for credit card processing and tracking sales, and the Square for Retail with intelligent and integrated tools purpose-built for more complex retail businesses.</p>

<p>With each of these systems comes different hardware and capabilities from different brands, including hardware, software, and additional features. Future growth — As your total orders, order stations, or restaurant locations grow, the cost for your POS system will grow, even though the features it offers likely won't. POS is the setup you have in place for processing face-to-face payments from customers. If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders.</p>

Square for Restaurants is particularly suited for basic quick-service coffee shops, food trucks, cafés, bars, etc. As well, retailers can offer special promotions and customer loyalty programs to promote customer loyalty and product branding.</p>
