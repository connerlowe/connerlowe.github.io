<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check.

Tableside service helps restaurants reduce or fully eliminate the constant travel by servers between tables and a terminal. Apart from inventory management, you should be able to coordinate customer orders, process payments, track all the restaurant elements, as well as manage your staff right from the point of sale system.</p>
<p>Once you've examined your business requirements, it's time to start exploring which POS solutions can meet your needs. Whether you run a restaurant or retail store, find the right POS systems for your small business. These are some of the feature we are providing in our Bar & Restaurant POS (Point Of Sale) system.

As you evaluate POS systems, you need to look at the costs, terms and features for each part of the system: software, hardware and payment processing.

Cloud-based POS systems that offer enterprise reporting give owners and managers secure access to detailed sales, inventory, and labor reports across all of their businesses or segmented for each individual location.</p>
<p>Some POS systems cater to retailers , whereas others cater to restaurants, so be sure to look for one that fits your specific needs. Accounting and payroll: Your POS system may include accounting services or integrate with third-party software like QuickBooks. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>

<p>Although each business is unique, the typical POS hardware you need for your retail business includes a tablet and stand, cash drawer, barcode scanner, and receipt printer.

The POS system should start providing useful information about inventory control and customers after a month of full-time use.</p>
