Needless to say that a television set cannot help directly in boosting your business but indirectly it can entertain your customers. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it.
