<p>Retail point of sale (POS) applications constantly battle adult age verification. Table management view makes it easy to track each table's orders, as well as reservations. ShopKeep's simple, powerful retail POS solution has allowed thousands of business owners to thrive while doing what they adore. Not one interface for all : A custom-made POS system interface calls for the incorporation of the unique in-house features that has taken the bar to its present height. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>

Shopify POS and Intuit QuickBooks Point of Sale charge monthly subscription fees for the use of their software along with an additional fee for payment processing.</p>
<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment.</p>

The solution supports secure and mobile payments like EMV and Apple Pay and integrates with multiple e-commerce platforms for efficient order processing and price updates. These PC's are accessorized with a cash drawer, bar code scanner, credit card swipe bar, check reader, receipt printer and sometimes other peripherals. Many restaurant POS solutions will even include inventory management and other business tools to make back-office functions easier.</p>
<p>A cloud-based POS system is a point of sale platform that stores information on the cloud. Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future.
