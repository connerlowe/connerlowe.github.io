<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. Processing transactions, training staff, inventory management, and accessing insights, are amongst the key features that should take you minutes, not hours to perform. Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. A restaurant POS system is a significant business investment, and it's important to treat it as such. Payments - If you plan on accepting credit card payments with your POS, then you need to sign up for a merchant account.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>

POS software companies can be found right online with just a simple search, and you will even find open source POS software, but again I suggest that you stay far away from it. They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
