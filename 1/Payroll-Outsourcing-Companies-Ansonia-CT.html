<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems.

Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too.
