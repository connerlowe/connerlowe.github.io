<p>The technology of EPoS or Electronic Point of Sale, has modernized the entire hospitality industry by making its transactions more swift and 100% accurate. Financial Statements: Finally, one of the most important features of a restaurant POS system. Restaurant-specific features include ingredient inventory tracking, table layouts, tableside and online ordering, franchise management, catering and delivery. Most cloud based pos companies provide a monthly subscription often upgrade their software, and you'll get the most up-to-date features with no additional fee. The software typically encompasses a myriad of functions, including payment processing and staff, customer, and inventory management.</p>
<p>Key features include table management, coursing, menu management and sales reporting. The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>

Bindo is another iPad POS system that boasts sophisticated—yet user-friendly—inventory management features. A slow and clunky bar POS system doesn't slow down your ability to hand customers their check; it also disenchants your staff and employee turnover rates are a significant problem for bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Other functions of a POS system are to maintain sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception. Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description. POS packages frequently come with integrated accounting modules, including general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and inventory control systems.</p>
