Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. Besides register capabilities, Revel has a ton of additional features, such as ingredient-level inventory management, analytics and QuickBooks integration. If you have an aging cash register or point of purchase system and would like a new modern retail or restaurant POS system that's both affordable and easy to use, then we would love to talk to you.</p>
