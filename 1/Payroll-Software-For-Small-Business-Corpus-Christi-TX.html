Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds.

Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure. In restaurants, the ability to track ingredients in real-time and set automatic stock alerts is extremely useful, while, for retail establishments, some systems come with the ability to create your own purchase orders and track inventory across multiple locations.</p>
<p>This system is integrated with the restaurant's POS and can accurately predict what is in on-hand inventory, as well as forecasting the size of the next supply order. The Lightspeed POS system has been designed with features that are specific for bars and nightclubs. Software: This includes the tech stack or platform with features like the ability to place orders, payment processing, and analytics and reporting.</p>
