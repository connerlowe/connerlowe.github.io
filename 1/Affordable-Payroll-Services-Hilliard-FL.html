<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server. In addition, you can use them with back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors Many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) are using these types of cloud-enabled POS services without the need to keep a physical back-end server in multiple locations.</p>

A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>
