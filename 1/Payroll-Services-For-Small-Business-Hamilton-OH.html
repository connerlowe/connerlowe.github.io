<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. Hike is a leading retail POS software in the cloud with everything you need to run & grow your business. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Keep in mind that, if you are going to be accepting credit and debit cards (and most businesses must), you're going to need a service that can process those payments. You can slice and dice sales data in a variety of ways to determine what products are selling best at what time, and to figure out everything from the optimal ways to arrange shelves and displays to what promotions are working best and when to change seasonal promotions.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>
<p>You mention how a point of sale is the most important place for customers to visit since it is the place the customer can go. I always thought the point of sale was more of a phase in the shopping experience but explain how it simply means it is where the customer pays for the goods or services provided.
