<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years.

<p>Such systems make quick customer assistance and remote inventory assessment for size, color etc. With an established means of sales control, your business growth can't outpace your ability as an owner to track profit levels against your financial obligations.
