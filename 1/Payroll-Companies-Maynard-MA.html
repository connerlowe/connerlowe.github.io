<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. Rather than paying a hefty monthly fee for bar POS software, this POS has streamlined base pricing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction. For about $4,000, you can get a traditional bar POS system which includes a touchscreen monitor with a built-in PC, a credit card reader, a cash drawer, a receipt printer, and all the cabling required. Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications.</p>

<p>Accept cash, checks, credit cards or even multiple payment types on any transaction. Special order templates, predefined or packages on-the-fly and a guided sales processes improve customer satisfaction with quick and accurate data entry. A specialized system with bar-specific features will do so much more for your business than a general POS. These stand-alone systems will store all necessary information for the purpose of delivering or transmitting the information to the central computer at a later time for processing.</p>

<p>With integrated credit card processing you are assured that the amount of the sale will match the amount charged on the credit card, eliminating the need to go back and match individual sales when the credit card batch does not match credit card sales. Although cloud-based software is easy to deploy and maintain for most bars, Ligan said it can be slow and prone to crash if you have an unstable internet connection.</p>
<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>
<p>The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. In order to open a customer tab, the bartender only needs to swipe the customer's card through the system. Square for Restaurants is particularly suited for basic quick-service coffee shops, food trucks, cafés, bars, etc. As well, retailers can offer special promotions and customer loyalty programs to promote customer loyalty and product branding.</p>
<p>All you really need is a system that has online capabilities, which makes them perfect for businesses that can't afford (or simply don't want to) replace their existing hardware. Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Having a POS system that can automatically track and control the inventory is a great benefit to business owners, as they can hire less stock personnel and reduce time in monitoring stock.</p>
