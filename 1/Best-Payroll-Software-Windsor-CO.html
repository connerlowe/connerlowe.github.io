Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profiles—Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow.

A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>

If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS).

For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?"
