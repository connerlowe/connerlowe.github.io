<p>The Point of Sale system from QuickBooks has always captured the attention and curiosity of many people. Free POS Software can be used as a replacement to similar third-party versions employed in common retail establishments. Our Retail POS software provides wide-ranging product research abilities as well as real-time usage of Inventory data all through your retail chain, that can help generate sales and profits when fulfilling the client. Superior inventory management : Managing a bar isn't only about the action that takes place in front but also about managing the backstage work.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>

All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy.

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
