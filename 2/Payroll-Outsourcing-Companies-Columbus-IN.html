As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need.</p>
<p>Proactive retailers are constantly striving to increase visibility into exactly who their customers are, how they're interacting with your stores, and what they want. With the increase in complexity of data, retailers usually do not get time to maintain sales performance analysis, category analysis and inventories.
