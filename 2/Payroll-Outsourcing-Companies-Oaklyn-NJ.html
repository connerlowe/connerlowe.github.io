<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.

<p>Manage staffing needs, menus, marketing campaigns, inventories proactively. If you own a store or shop of any genre, it is virtually impossible in today's competitive business world to survive without having a point of sales system in your cash terminal.
