<p>The term point-of-sale is used to describe a variety of things. In fact, cash register in a retail store plays a vital role in keeping track of sales, inventory etc. Most point of sale companies offer retail POS system bundles that include essential hardware components in different variations. Restaurants with a healthy online customer base need a POS system like Clover, that can handle online orders and delivery management. Improve the profitability of your retail business with POS Software.</p>

<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
