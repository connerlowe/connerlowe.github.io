<p>The term point-of-sale is used to describe a variety of things. In fact, cash register in a retail store plays a vital role in keeping track of sales, inventory etc. Most point of sale companies offer retail POS system bundles that include essential hardware components in different variations. Restaurants with a healthy online customer base need a POS system like Clover, that can handle online orders and delivery management.
