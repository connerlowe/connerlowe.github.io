<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection.

Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories.</p>
