<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>As a store owner, there is nothing more frustrating than seeing a long queue of customers waiting impatiently at the checkout counter. The POS Software helps you to manage business and control all transactions. It is an iPad-based solution perfect for restaurants, bars, and retail stores.
