<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Reward your best customers with a loyalty program tracked in your POS system. If you want control over your profit and loss, you need to start with a good inventory management function. Restaurant owners and managers can always check on their business anytime, even while on the go, thanks to TouchBistro's dependable connection and cloud-based menu management and reporting functionality. Businesses can access the software via the internet, or though iPad or iPhone apps.</p>
<p>Also, manage multiple locations, and offers multi-user staff logins for security, time and tip tracking. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not. Transform data into decisions with integrated reporting and analytics for real-time insight into KPIs, including best sellers, customer analysis and sales performance. As consumers, we see barcodes used all the time: purchasing from any retail store, renting a car, attending major events, flying, and even going to the doctor.</p>
