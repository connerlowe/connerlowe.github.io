<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server. In addition, you can use them with back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors Many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) are using these types of cloud-enabled POS services without the need to keep a physical back-end server in multiple locations.</p>

<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included.
