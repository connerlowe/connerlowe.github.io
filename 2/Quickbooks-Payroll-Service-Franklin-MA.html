<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations. This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>
<h2>The Advantages Of Accounting Services For Small Business Franklin</h2>
<p>If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock. If you need robust inventory management, reporting, integrations, and lots of customization options - consider Revel. Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
<p>As you can see, some basic hardware and software features are common to both QSR and FSR point of sale systems. Although you should consider your business's unique POS system needs, we think Square offers the best overall package to fit most small businesses, from restaurants to retail shops. Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store.</p>
