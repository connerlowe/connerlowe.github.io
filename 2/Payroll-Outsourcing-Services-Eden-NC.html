<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>
<p>Customers can pay by chip, swipe and tap like Apple PayÂ® and Google Pay, at the point of sale or on the go. Both the retail and restaurant versions of its POS software have a rich assortment of back-office tools to help you manage your business, with inventory, purchase ordering, reporting and CRM features. One such function includes the synergies, which are created by assimilating them with different kinds of back-end applications like inventory management and customer relationship management ( CRM ).</p>

<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
