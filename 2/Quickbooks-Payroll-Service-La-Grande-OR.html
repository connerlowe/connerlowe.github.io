<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>Restaurant point of sale systems cost any from the price of a daily cup of coffee to a daily surf-n-turf dinner. Having a POS system that accepts several types of payments establishes credibility with customers as soon as they walk in your store. Designed for an iPAD, this POS assists jewellers with sales processing and the management of their business. Comcash offers cloud-based POS software for retailers and a mobile POS app for the iPhone and iPod Touch that can be used as a line buster in retail stores or to take orders tableside in restaurants.</p>

Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place. Two robust sets of tools are offered - a free Square POS for credit card processing and tracking sales, and the Square for Retail with intelligent and integrated tools purpose-built for more complex retail businesses.</p>
