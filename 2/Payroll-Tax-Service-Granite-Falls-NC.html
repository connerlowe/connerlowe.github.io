<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need. Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way. After all, most of us don't think of food as being "inventory," and therefore don't see a logical connection between a UPC bar code number and a yogurt parfait.</p>

The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM. However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>Mobile POS systems are always less expensive, especially if you already own tablets. Win back churned customers and increase customer lifetime value with in-built loyalty that tracks all customer contacts and purchasing preferences; launch targeted promotions, offers, and personalized campaigns that keep customers coming back. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place.</p>

You can even control inventory right at the cash register with point-of-sale (POS) software systems. With Dallas POS, we only offer our customers the future of affordable and simple point of sale software and hardware.
