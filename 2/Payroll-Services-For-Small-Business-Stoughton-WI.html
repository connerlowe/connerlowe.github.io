<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>
<p>As well as the brilliant CRM tools, Revel POS offers the standard suite of sales, inventory, and employee management. The advanced POS solutions offer sales trends like seasonal demand in products and information related to stock management. POS requires a proper setup with all the devices, and also multiple types of hardware devices and versions of the software.

<p>Increased Employee Customer Interaction: Because POS systems are efficient at reducing the amount of time employees have to spend doing business operation tasks, they will have more time to spend with the customer. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>

<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
