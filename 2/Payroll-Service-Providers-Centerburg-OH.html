<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. It has never been easier to take advantage of the benefits of a point of sale (POS) system designed for restaurants.
