<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye. Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. There are so many restaurants out there who offer the home delivery feature for their customers.

Modern restaurant POS systems provide a platform that sits at the heart of any food and beverage operation, large or small, helping to enhance the customer experience and streamline business operations. Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list.</p>
