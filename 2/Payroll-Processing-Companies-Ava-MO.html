<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

Understanding what a POS system is—its software and hardware components, as well as capabilities—will enable you to make an educated buying decision.</p>
<p>A point of sale system allows you as a business owner to control your inventory levels in real time. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS.</p>

<p>If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. This is especially true when the rush in the retail stores is more. Reporting and Back Office - The users can review the sales reports and can manage inventory, employees along with the customers. If you choose a cloud-based restaurant POS system, you'll be able to make changes to your menu or pricing on the fly.</p>
<p>Customers can purchase products online and pick them up at their preferred store outlets, they can order products not available in stores and have them shipped directly, and they can also return a product at the store or have it collected from the desired location, irrespective of the channel of purchase. Nowadays cash registers have become more sophisticated and they are used to process credit cards. Working with leading merchant providers from around the world, Vend allows businesses to choose the best way to accept payments, including debit, credit and gift cards.</p>
<p>Lightspeed allows restaurants to easily build and update menus, adjust floor plans in real time and update stock inventory. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
<p>A lot of general POS systems bill themselves as suitable for use in a restaurant. While the software powering a restaurant POS is the main element of a POS system, hardware is important as well. Some mobile POS systems allow the server to place orders right at the table, saving on time and reducing the chances of making a mistake. Cloud-Based - The user can access the cloud-based system from anywhere in the world as it stores data online.</p>
