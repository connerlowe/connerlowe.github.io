But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Dinlr Waiter is a POS system for restaurants that runs on iPads and iPhones. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.

In the following comparison chart, we chose to review the top 20 providers instead of our original list of top 10 restaurant POS systems.</p>

<p>With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Let's now look at the things to consider before buying any restaurant management software for your business.
