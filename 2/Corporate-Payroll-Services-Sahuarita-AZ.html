<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>However, customers tend to abandon their cards if the balances get below a certain amount. Built with advanced inventory features, in-house marketing capabilities, and the ability to integrate with virtually any payment processor, talech takes your standard POS to the next level. Some point of sale systems only accept online payments. By using an API-led approach to connectivity, Buffalo Wild Wings was able to integrate their POS system to not one, but three systems--creating a unique solution that provides their restaurant chains with unprecedented visibility into their beer inventory.</p>
<p>Dinlr Waiter is a POS system for restaurants that runs on iPads and iPhones. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.

<p>Not only does this give your sales associates tools to better serve your customers - because they'll have access to shoppers' purchasing history and preferences for clienteling and they'll be able to get them what they want every time - but it will also give you the meticulous visibility you need to really see what's happening in your business.

Bindo is another iPad POS system that boasts sophisticated—yet user-friendly—inventory management features. A slow and clunky bar POS system doesn't slow down your ability to hand customers their check; it also disenchants your staff and employee turnover rates are a significant problem for bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Prominent features include omnichannel delivery, integrated POS, cost control, kiosks, and yes, even kitchen management. As an example, for a small business with one POS machine, we estimate you'll pay around $1,250 for hardware and about $69 per month for a software subscription.

Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
