<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>Once you've examined your business requirements, it's time to start exploring which POS solutions can meet your needs. Whether you run a restaurant or retail store, find the right POS systems for your small business. These are some of the feature we are providing in our Bar & Restaurant POS (Point Of Sale) system.
