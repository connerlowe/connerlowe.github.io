<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Empower your stores to play a new, expanded role in today's omnichannel reality and dramatically simplify your IT infrastructure requirements with Openbravo web and cloud-based retail POS system. Lightspeed Retail POS system users outside of the US, as well as Lightspeed Restaurant POS users around the world, do not currently have access to Lightspeed Payments. The Lavu Restaurant Point-of-Sale Station Kit costs $850 and it comes with an Epson M30 receipt printer, an iDynamo credit card reader, a cash drawer, and an iPad.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

Understanding what a POS system is—its software and hardware components, as well as capabilities—will enable you to make an educated buying decision.</p>
<p>Accept cash, checks, credit cards or even multiple payment types on any transaction. Special order templates, predefined or packages on-the-fly and a guided sales processes improve customer satisfaction with quick and accurate data entry.

These stand-alone systems will store all necessary information for the purpose of delivering or transmitting the information to the central computer at a later time for processing.</p>

Reporting and Back Office - The users can review the sales reports and can manage inventory, employees along with the customers. If you choose a cloud-based restaurant POS system, you'll be able to make changes to your menu or pricing on the fly.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>

<p>Small businesses can benefit from a suite of features housed in something as easy and portable as an iPad and accessible through the cloud, because flexibility can be crucial in the restaurant business. With the online payment gateway, restaurants can accept modern payment methods like Apple Pay. And just like Lightspeed, ShopKeep Restaurant POS is available via a web-based dashboard and an iOS app, which serves as the primary cash register.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Unfortunately, however, the easy-to-use software layout does not provide the advanced tools you'd need to manage a full-service restaurant.</p>
