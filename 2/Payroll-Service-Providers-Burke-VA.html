Shopify POS and Intuit QuickBooks Point of Sale charge monthly subscription fees for the use of their software along with an additional fee for payment processing.</p>
<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.

<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years.
