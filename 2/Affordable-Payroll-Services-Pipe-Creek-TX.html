<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers. In fact, research shows that more than half (52 percent) of retailers are arming store associates with mobile technology—and another 26 percent plan to do the same. Tillpoint is the multi-award-winning POS & Restaurant Management System. Mobile POS is now available that keeps POS users from being tied down to a specific location in a store.</p>
<p>Designed for food service businesses and restaurants, this cloud-based restaurant and catering management solution manages inventories and recipes. We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers.

<h2>Time Retail Payment Systems Pipe Creek</h2>
<p>The point” of sale payment is when a customer and merchant exchange products or services completing a POS transaction aka point of sale purchase. This will make your customers happy as they won't be overcharged, and their cost won't fluctuate haphazardly, depending on which driver delivered the food. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. A cloud-based POS system, Lightspeed has a restaurant-specific design that streamlines hospitality functions for the manager and customer.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
