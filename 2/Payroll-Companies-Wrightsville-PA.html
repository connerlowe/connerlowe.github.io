<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. The key to servicing such a wide variety of retailers is our commitment to work with you directly to customize a system to meet your unique business needs.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system.

Last but not least, it's the first tool of it's kind that allows restaurants to manage in-house, delivery, and to-go orders all in one place. Earlier in this article, we mentioned that POS systems weren't solely based on taking payments.</p>
