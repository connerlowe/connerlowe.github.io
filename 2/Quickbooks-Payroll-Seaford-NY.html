There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe.

It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>
