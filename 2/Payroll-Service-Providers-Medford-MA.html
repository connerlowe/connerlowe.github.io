Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis. On the surface, most point of sale systems promise the same basic functionality: The ability to accept payments, track sales, manage inventory, and keep track of customer data. There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>1. POS systems provide a business with a real-time detailed report of sales.

With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload. Much like online ordering, customers are interested in on-demand services that reduce wait times. Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>

<p>Although each business is unique, the typical POS hardware you need for your retail business includes a tablet and stand, cash drawer, barcode scanner, and receipt printer. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity. It would be ideal to run the new system in tandem with the old one for a week or more, but this is a luxury that many stores cannot indulge in. The POS system should start providing useful information about inventory control and customers after a month of full-time use.</p>
