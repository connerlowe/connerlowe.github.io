According to the State of Small Business report, an incredible 46% of small businesses don't track their inventory or use a manual process to do so. A Point Of Sale (POS) System is the combination of hardware and software that is used to sell stuff to customers, and organise the processes related to sales. The point of sale system is designed for delivery, carry-out or dine-in type restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work.

Integration with 3rd Party Apps ‚Äî businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
