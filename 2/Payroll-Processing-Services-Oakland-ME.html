<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business.

With Instore, you can take orders and accept payments from anywhere in your store, manage your menu or product catalog, analyze sales data, track inventory, issue gift cards, and customize receipts with coupons and special offers.</p>
<p>Manages the inventory- The point of sale software maintains the business' inventory. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. It is a cost-effective restaurant billing software for small business , which is also user-friendly. A POS system's inventory management module must provide complete visibility and accountability at store level at all times. For the purposes of calculating the sales total and change due this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems are still comprised of hardware and software components but include many new functions too. To help you minimize lost sales due to out of stocks, use replenishment capabilities in Retail Pro.
