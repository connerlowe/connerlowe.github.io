<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it.

Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
