<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check. Then when it comes to payment processing, Square for restaurants proves to be quite a flexible solution. This is a suitable point-of-sale option if you do not manage a lot of inventory and you need to be mobile. Besides, nowadays, most of the barcode scanner may also integrate with Inventory Management system to change stock levels automatically and efficiently.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
