<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check. Then when it comes to payment processing, Square for restaurants proves to be quite a flexible solution. This is a suitable point-of-sale option if you do not manage a lot of inventory and you need to be mobile.

Square POS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as accept credit cards with your iPhone, Android, and iPad along with the flexibility to accept credit card payments anywhere, from Square headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
