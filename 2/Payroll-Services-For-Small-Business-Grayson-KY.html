<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>

Six ways Vend's point of sale system will help you grow your retail business.

<p>This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter. It is a good idea to talk to your employees and your customers to get feedback on what kinds of features would help. Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.</p>
