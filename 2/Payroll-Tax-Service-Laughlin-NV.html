<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. The key to servicing such a wide variety of retailers is our commitment to work with you directly to customize a system to meet your unique business needs.</p>
<p>Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business. The POS is made up of software along with hardware. Software - The user should study the options capabilities and costs to ensure that the point of sale app is the right fit for their business needs. Some POS systems will even accept Apple Pay or Amazon Pay, which are contactless” payment types.</p>
<p>Substitutions, drink recipe lists, price scheduling, tab management, and split inventory for liquor pours are just a few features to look for in bar POS software. Another important aspect of POS software is broad support for new payment systems. Lightspeed register terminals are iPad-based and provide access to the backend business management system. However, it is advisable to opt for the software that best suits your business requirements and smoothens your business operations to provide top-notch customer service.</p>

<p>Support and training are included as part of the subscription, as well as free lifetime software updates and full access to all future features and modules. However, retailers need to carefully choose these systems wisely. Most POS systems for bars and restaurants will have this feature. And speaking of which, it turns that the Lightspeed Restaurant POS system has a pretty flexible payment framework. The tipping function ensures accurate earnings calculations and easy tip splits at business close time.</p>
<p>Despite the cash register motif, however, when people talk about POS systems, they're mostly referring to the software, which could be client-based or cloud-based. Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location.

The advanced POS system runs from an iPad or desktop computer and can integrate with Lightspeed's own ecommerce platform, additional apps and add-ons to enhance the in-store service - and of course the backend analytics and management functions. However, with hundreds of POS systems on the market, sifting through them to find the best solution for your business is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Some POS systems cater to retailers , whereas others cater to restaurants, so be sure to look for one that fits your specific needs. Accounting and payroll: Your POS system may include accounting services or integrate with third-party software like QuickBooks. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.</p>
<p>POS systems like Lightspeed can integrate with payment processors to automatically transit information between your inventory system and card reader.

<p>A point-of-sale system gives you the ability to accept whatever form of payment your customers prefer. Scanning the bar code at the Point of Sale rather than typing an SKU virtually eliminates errors in pricing and inventory. Global inventory, cross-channel orders and customer profiles are completely visible in real-time so associates are equipped to deliver thoughtful, knowledge-based interactions with a personal touch.</p>
<p>Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. These features include the ability for customers to use two types of payment, for example, or to allow for returns, special pricing (for sales or special customers), gift cards, and surge pricing. There are many different types of point-of-sale systems for each kind of business, so we've outlined some key points to consider as you shop.</p>
<p>While Rezku may not have as many robust features as other POS software, it still gives an impressive showing. In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender. Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>
<p>A cloud-based POS system is a point of sale platform that stores information on the cloud. Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future. Better software systems allow for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and salesperson.</p>
