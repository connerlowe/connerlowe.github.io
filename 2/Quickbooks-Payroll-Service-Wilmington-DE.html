Some basic restaurant POS functionalities like gift cards come at an extra cost. On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.</p>

Retail Pro is an enterprise-level POS system for specialty retailers. POS systems for restaurants are designed to streamline certain tasks and help you run a smooth operation.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Build Recipes: make recipes and get information about their nutritional value to prepare excellent menus and manage your food costs well. The only negative to implementing a new restaurant management system is the training time and challenge of learning new software.
