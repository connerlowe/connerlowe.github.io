<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. Rather than paying a hefty monthly fee for bar POS software, this POS has streamlined base pricing.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner.</p>
<p>Also, manage multiple locations, and offers multi-user staff logins for security, time and tip tracking. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not. Transform data into decisions with integrated reporting and analytics for real-time insight into KPIs, including best sellers, customer analysis and sales performance. As consumers, we see barcodes used all the time: purchasing from any retail store, renting a car, attending major events, flying, and even going to the doctor.</p>

<p>Reduce the time spent by your employees behind an antiquated cash register and free up their time to pay more attention to sales. This will enable them to drive inventory management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management apart from generating big data analytics that retailers can use for targeted marketing and sales campaigns. Cloud-based POS also helps to expand POS systems in addition to computers to mobile and tablet devices.</p>
<p>Perhaps a retail store uses touch technology when they check out a customer at the department store. The business owners only have to download an app and create an account for a mobile POS system. Managing inventory in a retail business is very challenging because the stock is always in flux and the demand of items keeps shifting. The software has become a staple for many small businesses requiring a fully functional POS that does not break the bank.</p>

<p>Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features. These fees will be charged to your business based on how many transactions you run, how large each transaction is, and the type of card the customer is paying with. The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>Many POS systems are tailor-made and marketed to specific types of businesses, especially full-service restaurants or retail. Modern restaurant POS systems provide a platform that sits at the heart of any food and beverage operation, large or small, helping to enhance the customer experience and streamline business operations. Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list.</p>
