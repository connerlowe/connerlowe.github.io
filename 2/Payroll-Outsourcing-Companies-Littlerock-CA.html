<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. Self-service kiosks - A large self-service kiosk can help customers serve themselves, saving your staff time. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant. On top of payment processing fees, many point of sale systems will charge your business for using their software. The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges.</p>
<p>Restaurants process high volumes of credit card transactions and cash daily, making a restaurant software necessary. We provide powerful Management Systems, including POS hardware and POS software, Inventory and eCommerce solutions based on Client needs using the latest leading-edge technology.

Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way.

Hence, the customer support from YourGoGetter is available round the clock to solve all the problems as effectively and in as less time as possible.

<p>From the manager portal, you can view your sales data, schedule pricing events like happy hour, and manage your menu.

With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
