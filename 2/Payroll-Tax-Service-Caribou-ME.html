<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds. As with all POS systems, owners can track sales, deliveries, inventory, employee schedules, and payroll. Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system.

Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
