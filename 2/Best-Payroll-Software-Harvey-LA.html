<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS.

With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>

The earliest POS systems were nothing more than written receipts, but retailers now prefer electronic POS solutions These streamline the sales process, as well as allowing the merchant to collect valuable sales data.
