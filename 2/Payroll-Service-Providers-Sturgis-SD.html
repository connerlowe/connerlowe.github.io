<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>If your bar has a kitchen and serves food, easily send orders from front of the house to kitchen display systems in the back. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. Lavu POS systems centralize your data storage in a cloud-based system to give management complete control over the program. Using the right POS solution for your restaurant can expedite more than just food orders.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>
<h2>Top Reasons Why Every HR Manager Should Use Employee Management Software Sturgis</h2>
<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. Retail businesses can use the system for both stationary and mobile devices. The POS hardware costs include tablets, monitors, card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, and self- service kiosks. As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need.</p>
<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment.</p>
