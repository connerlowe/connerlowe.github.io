<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>Our Restaurant Software are distributed on Cloud so data retrieval is real time. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>

<p>If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock. If you need robust inventory management, reporting, integrations, and lots of customization options - consider Revel. Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
<p>All modern POS systems have a frontend interface for the point of sale and a backend (sometimes called ‘backoffice' or ‘dashboard') side for behind-the-scenes analytics and management functions. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. You can easily accept cash payments as well as use credit cards, debit cards, etc. The companies and businesses get hold of commerce by making use of point of sale systems that helps in promoting longevity in the business.</p>

Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>Since this is a cloud-based Point of Sales system, you can always check your inventory level and order new goods whether you are in the office, at home or on the go. You can control your inventory through streamlined reorder processes and easily transfer goods from one location to another. The POS software stores the information and maintains it within a database. There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely.</p>
<p>Point of Sale Security : Using restaurant POS software, all employees are accountable for any sales rung up on their personal ID. Servers can not alter checks without a password, putting a stop to unapproved discounts for friends and family members, and eliminating the opportunity for theft. With most modern retail POS systems you can have instant access to sales and expense data from your stores during the business hours.</p>
<p>For complicated functions like employee time tracking and synchronized inventory management, the user can make use of this system. A complete hospitality POS system (choose from cafe, restaurant, or nightclub and bar configurations) with all the hardware you need will run you $1,799.
